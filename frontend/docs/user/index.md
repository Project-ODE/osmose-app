# Start using APLOSE

APLOSE is an audio annotation platform developed by the [OSmOSE](https://osmose.ifremer.fr) team.
The tool allows to annotate audio files based on their spectrogram, by one or more users.

A demo can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwANvyMx-Wg)

APLOSE uses pre-segmented audio and pre-calculated spectrogram (thanks to
the [OSEKit](https://github.com/Project-OSmOSE/OSEkit)).
Indeed, no calculation are made through APLOSE, which significantly reduces loading time while annotating.
