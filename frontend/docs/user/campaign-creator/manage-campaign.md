## Update annotators

To update which annotators are on which file range, you must open the "Detailed progression" in the right panel.
And then "Add annotators".

![](/campaign-creator/edit.png)

You can now edit or remove existing annotators or add new ones thanks to the search bar below the table.
To edit or remove an annotator file range when the annotator already started to annotate, you must unlock it first to prevent unwanted edits.

:::warning
If you unassigned already annotated files, the annotations will be lost.
