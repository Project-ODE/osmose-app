          In October, a scientific paper written by 3 members of the team (Julie Beesau, Flore Samaran and Maëlle Torterotot) and a former intern (Cécile Perrier de la Bathie) was published in Deep Sea Research II - Topical Studies in Oceanography.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim of this study was to collect new information about marine mammal presence around two ecological hotspots in the Indian Ocean and to test the feasibility of using an acoustic glider to monitor the acoustic soundscape in remote regions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this study, the Sea Explorer glider developed by ALSEAMAR was first deployed around Walters Shoal for 10 days in May 2017 and then around St. Paul and Amsterdam islands for about a month in March 2019 (Figure 2).

                To assess the marine mammal acoustic presence, all the data was manually visualised in the form of spectrograms by using the annotation platform APLOSE. Two annotation campaigns per dataset were organized, one for the low frequency sounds (mostly from baleen whales) and the other for high frequency sounds (mostly from delphinids, blackfish and sperm whales).
              </p>
              <p>
                The results (Figure 3) show that at both locations, the bioacoustic activity is relatively high with 40% of the recordings positive to bioacoustic detections in Walters Shoal and over 70% around St. Paul and Amsterdam islands. Acoustic data adds significant value in identifying the species of large baleen whales. Indeed, while visual observations only report the presence of unrecognized baleen whales, acoustics reveals the presence of multiple blue whale sub-species and acoustic populations and of fin whales. This study also confirmed the significant presence of sperm whales and killer or pilot whales around St. Paul and Amsterdam, and shows a clear difference between the high acoustic presence around the islands and the low acoustic presence during the journey between both islands, that suggests an attractivity of the islands for these species.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, if a glider was to be deployed again in the same area, it would be interesting to repeat the same track to be able to compare the results with the deployment presented here. Future glider deployments could also focus on more limited areas, for example the southeast of St. Paul island, with a much finer spatial sampling. Generally speaking, it would be interesting to compare the bioacoustic activity and diversity with that of oligotroph offshore remote areas surrounding these two regions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recently, the team was trained by Alseamar to deploy and pilot the glider on their own. The next mission will likely be conducted in June 2023, in the offshore Bay of Biscay.To be continued…

  The theme for this seminar was “Anthropic pressures and associated impact”. This subject is closely related to the APOCADO project (lien page projet). The first results of CETIROISE and APOCADO projects and more generally the benefits of passive acoustics to monitor marine mammals populations were presented along with different presentations from several other speakers from Saturday to mid-Sunday. The presentations will be available soon on <a href='https://www.observatoire-pelagis.cnrs.fr/echouages/seminaires-rne/'> Pelagis website </a>.

<p>
  On Sunday afternoon we had the chance to go out and watch the biggest seal colony in France which is settled in the Baie de Sommes, just a short drive from the seminar’s location. We spotted a group of Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and some Atlantic grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the distance. They lay on Baie de Somme beaches to get some rest, give birth, attend to the pups or shed. It was a reminder that one should not get too close from these animals as they are easily frightened and one might put the well-being of the pups in jeopardy.

  On September 30th 2022, part of the team was involved in the 18th edition of the nation-wide public exhibition called “Nuit des chercheurs”, that took place at Océanopolis in Brest. This year’s theme was “the unexpected” and we prepared some animations on our stand. Visitors could use a microphone to get familiar with spectrogram representation (time vs frequency representation of sound). They also discovered a variety of underwater sounds through a quiz.

  He also exchanged with students from the Harteloire secondary school, by sharing with them an unexpected story that happened to him during his research (failed experiment, surprising result, unanticipated action) but did not tell the end of the story! 3 choices of resolution were offered to the students, they had to guess the right one. Here is Gabriel’ story and the three offered answers. You too can guess which one is the true one!
</p>
<p>
  During a mission in Hawaï where a conference on passive acoustics to monitor cetaceans was held, Gabriel woke up at dawn with his colleagues in order to board a ship to do some humpback whale watching. After a long waiting period, he and his colleagues saw…
</p>
<p>
  <span class='fw-bold'>Answer A:</span> Nothing, absolutely nothing although the visibility conditions were excellent and the setting perfect, they saw nothing !
</p>
<p>
  <span class='fw-bold'>Answer B:</span> They were not aware that militaries were working on mine-sweeping an area a few kilometres away. They heard a dull sound then they spotted huge water explosions of +10m. Terrifying sight !
</p>
<p>
  <span class='fw-bold'>Answer C:</span> At sunrise, a hundred metres from them they saw one, then two, then three water bursts getting closer and closer! It was a small group of humpback whales passing by. Not frightened by the ship, they eventually got next to them and offered quite a unique show.
</p>
<p>
  <span class='fw-bold'>Solution :</span> The right answer was answer A! Indeed, observation of species in its natural habitat can be quite unpredictable, one cannot control it!

The annual RNE (Réseau National Échouage – French Stranding Network)
seminar was held the 19th and 20th of November in Saint Valéry sur
Sommes, near the Baie de Somme. The RNE is NGO that keeps track of
marine mammals strandings along the French coast since 1970. All
scientific actions are led by Pelagis, a national marine mammals and
seabirds observatory. This year’ seminary was jointly organised by
Pelagis, Picardie Nature association, Office Français de la
Biodiversité (OFB) and gathered more than 120 people from all over
the country.

“Every year a seminar is organised by Pelagis, the network leader.
It is an opportunity to forge links with collaborators from all
walks of life and to exchange knowledge on the state of marine
mammal populations in environments as different as Rouzic or
Martinique.”

The theme for this seminar was “Anthropic pressures and associated
impact”. This subject is closely related to the APOCADO project
(lien page projet). The first results of CETIROISE and APOCADO
projects and more generally the benefits of passive acoustics to
monitor marine mammals populations were presented along with
different presentations from several other speakers from Saturday to
mid-Sunday. The presentations will be available soon on <a href='https://www.observatoire-pelagis.cnrs.fr/echouages/seminaires-rne/'> Pelagis website </a>.
</p>
<p>
On Sunday afternoon we had the chance to go out and watch the
biggest seal colony in France which is settled in the Baie de
Sommes, just a short drive from the seminar’s location. We spotted a
group of Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and some Atlantic grey seals
(Halichoerus grypus) in the distance. They lay on Baie de Somme
beaches to get some rest, give birth, attend to the pups or shed. It
was a reminder that one should not get too close from these animals
as they are easily frightened and one might put the well-being of
the pups in jeopardy.

<p>
Thanks to all the participants and to the organisation who put this
event together!

On September 30th 2022, part of the team was involved in the
18th edition of the nation-wide public exhibition called “Nuit
des chercheurs”, that took place at Océanopolis in Brest. This
year’s theme was “the unexpected” and we prepared some
animations on our stand. Visitors could use a microphone to get
familiar with spectrogram representation (time vs frequency
representation of sound). They also discovered a variety of
underwater sounds through a quiz.

work to dress a portrait of a researcher's daily activities.&nbsp;

<p>
He also exchanged with students from the Harteloire secondary
school, by sharing with them an unexpected story that happened to
him during his research (failed experiment, surprising result,
unanticipated action) but did not tell the end of the story! 3
choices of resolution were offered to the students, they had to
guess the right one. Here is Gabriel’ story and the three offered
answers. You too can guess which one is the true one!
</p>
<p>
During a mission in Hawaï where a conference on passive acoustics to
monitor cetaceans was held, Gabriel woke up at dawn with his
colleagues in order to board a ship to do some humpback whale
watching. After a long waiting period, he and his colleagues saw…
</p>
<p>
<span class='fw-bold'>Answer A:</span> Nothing,
absolutely nothing although the visibility conditions were excellent
and the setting perfect, they saw nothing !
</p>
<p>
<span class='fw-bold'>Answer B:</span> They were not
aware that militaries were working on mine-sweeping an area a few
kilometres away. They heard a dull sound then they spotted huge
water explosions of +10m. Terrifying sight !
</p>
<p>
<span class='fw-bold'>Answer C:</span> At sunrise, a
hundred metres from them they saw one, then two, then three water
bursts getting closer and closer! It was a small group of humpback
whales passing by. Not frightened by the ship, they eventually got
next to them and offered quite a unique show.
</p>
<p>
<span class='fw-bold'>Solution :</span> The right answer
was answer A! Indeed, observation of species in its natural habitat
can be quite unpredictable, one cannot control it!

The 34th annual conference of the European Cetacean Society was held from April 16 to 20, 2023 in O Grove, Galicia, in northwestern Spain, on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. This conference is organized by the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute (BDRI) with the theme: "Our oceans, our future. Behavioral ecology of marine mammals & sustainable use of marine resources"
</p>
<p>
This year, the conference brought together 600 participants from 41 different countries. For 4 days, conferences, presentations and moments of exchange allowed researchers to present their new results, to exchange with each other, to create links, to advance scientific knowledge on the study of marine mammals and their preservation.

Part of the OSmOSE team went there to take part in discussions and enrich their thoughts.
It was also an opportunity for us to organize a workshop entitled "Forward-looking discussion on passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammals for MSFD D1" with the aim of discussing with other EU Member States who are considering the use of acoustics as a method for monitoring cetaceans in the Marine Strategic Framework Directive (MSFD) and how it could be integrated into the assessment of Good Environmental Status.
