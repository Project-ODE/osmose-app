          In October, a scientific paper written by 3 members of the team (Julie Beesau, Flore Samaran and Maëlle Torterotot) and a former intern (Cécile Perrier de la Bathie) was published in Deep Sea Research II - Topical Studies in Oceanography.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim of this study was to collect new information about marine mammal presence around two ecological hotspots in the Indian Ocean and to test the feasibility of using an acoustic glider to monitor the acoustic soundscape in remote regions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this study, the Sea Explorer glider developed by ALSEAMAR was first deployed around Walters Shoal for 10 days in May 2017 and then around St. Paul and Amsterdam islands for about a month in March 2019 (Figure 2).

                To assess the marine mammal acoustic presence, all the data was manually visualised in the form of spectrograms by using the annotation platform APLOSE. Two annotation campaigns per dataset were organized, one for the low frequency sounds (mostly from baleen whales) and the other for high frequency sounds (mostly from delphinids, blackfish and sperm whales).
              </p>
              <p>
                The results (Figure 3) show that at both locations, the bioacoustic activity is relatively high with 40% of the recordings positive to bioacoustic detections in Walters Shoal and over 70% around St. Paul and Amsterdam islands. Acoustic data adds significant value in identifying the species of large baleen whales. Indeed, while visual observations only report the presence of unrecognized baleen whales, acoustics reveals the presence of multiple blue whale sub-species and acoustic populations and of fin whales. This study also confirmed the significant presence of sperm whales and killer or pilot whales around St. Paul and Amsterdam, and shows a clear difference between the high acoustic presence around the islands and the low acoustic presence during the journey between both islands, that suggests an attractivity of the islands for these species.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, if a glider was to be deployed again in the same area, it would be interesting to repeat the same track to be able to compare the results with the deployment presented here. Future glider deployments could also focus on more limited areas, for example the southeast of St. Paul island, with a much finer spatial sampling. Generally speaking, it would be interesting to compare the bioacoustic activity and diversity with that of oligotroph offshore remote areas surrounding these two regions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recently, the team was trained by Alseamar to deploy and pilot the glider on their own. The next mission will likely be conducted in June 2023, in the offshore Bay of Biscay.To be continued…
