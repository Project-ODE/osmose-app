# Getting Started with Storybook

Storybook is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation with several libraries (React in our case).

It's a **development** tool (nothing is shipped to production) aiming at **testing** components. It allows the developer to adjust all the input parameters of the components to ensure that it is working as expected in all contexts.

Example stories (and attached components) can be found in the `src/stories` folder (to be deleted when enough components from the project will be referenced in dedicated stories).
